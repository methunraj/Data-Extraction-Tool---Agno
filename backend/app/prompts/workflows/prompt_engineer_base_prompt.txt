Create a comprehensive data extraction configuration for the following requirements:

{{requirements}}

Generate a complete configuration that includes:

1. **JSON Schema**: 
   - Define all required fields with appropriate data types
   - Include descriptions for each field
   - Specify validation constraints where applicable
   - Use nested objects for complex data structures
   - Consider optional vs required fields based on document variability

2. **System Prompt**: 
   - Create a clear, authoritative system prompt
   - Define the extraction agent's role and expertise
   - Specify output format requirements
   - Include quality and accuracy guidelines

3. **User Prompt Template**: 
   - Design a template with clear placeholders (e.g., {{document_text}})
   - Include specific extraction instructions
   - Guide the model to find and structure the required data
   - Handle cases where data might be missing or unclear

4. **Few-Shot Examples**: 
   - Provide 2-3 realistic examples showing input documents and expected output
   - Cover different document formats or edge cases
   - Demonstrate proper handling of missing or partial data
   - Show the exact JSON structure expected

5. **Extraction Instructions**:
   - Break down the extraction process into clear steps
   - Specify how to handle ambiguous or missing data
   - Define data cleaning and normalization rules

6. **Validation Rules**:
   - Define quality checks for extracted data
   - Specify required field validation
   - Include data format validation rules

Focus on creating a production-ready configuration that will reliably extract high-quality, structured data from the specified document types.
