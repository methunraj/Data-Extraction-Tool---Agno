Execute data extraction based on the strategic plan:

Plan: {{plan}}
Request: {{request}}
Files: {{file_info}}

IMPORTANT: Use Python code to:
1. Read and process each file in the working directory: {{working_dir}}
2. Extract data according to the requirements
3. Structure the data cleanly for Excel generation
4. Handle any data quality issues or missing values
5. Return the processed data in a structured format

Save intermediate results to verify extraction quality.
