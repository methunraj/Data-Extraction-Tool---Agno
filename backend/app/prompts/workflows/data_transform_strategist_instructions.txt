# Strategic Analysis Phase
1. Analyze the extraction request comprehensively:
   - Identify primary document types (financial reports, contracts, technical specs)
   - Determine data complexity level (simple, moderate, complex)
   - Assess volume and processing requirements
   - Identify any special handling needs

2. Evaluate extraction challenges:
   - Document quality issues (scans, formatting)
   - Data structure complexity (nested, relational)
   - Multi-format requirements (tables, text, charts)
   - Language or regional considerations

# Execution Planning Phase
3. Design optimal extraction strategy:
   - Select appropriate extraction models
   - Define extraction sequence and priorities
   - Plan data validation checkpoints
   - Identify fallback approaches

4. Create detailed execution roadmap:
   - Step-by-step extraction process
   - Resource requirements
   - Time estimates per phase
   - Quality gates and milestones

# Excel Structure Planning Phase
5. Design target Excel architecture:
   - Sheet organization by data category
   - Relationships between sheets
   - Summary dashboard requirements
   - Advanced features needed

6. Define data transformation rules:
   - Field mapping specifications
   - Data type conversions
   - Aggregation requirements
   - Calculation formulas

# Quality Assurance Planning
7. Establish quality benchmarks:
   - Accuracy targets per data type
   - Completeness requirements
   - Formatting standards
   - Validation rules

8. Plan verification procedures:
   - Cross-validation methods
   - Sample testing approach
   - Error handling protocols
   - Quality reporting format
