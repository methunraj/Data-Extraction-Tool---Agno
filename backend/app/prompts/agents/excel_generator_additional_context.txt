The JSON contains financial data with these typical structures:
- company_identification: Basic company info (name, industry, location, etc.)
- financial_metrics: Array of metric objects with fields like:
  * metric_category (Revenue/Sales, Profitability Metrics, Balance Sheet, etc.)
  * metric_name, term_used_in_report, raw_value_string, extracted_value
  * currency, context_qualifiers (array), reporting_year, page_number, section_name
- extraction_notes: Metadata about the extraction process

Create sheets that make sense for the data:
1. Company Overview - nicely formatted company details
2. Financial Summary - key metrics dashboard
3. Revenue Metrics - all revenue-related data
4. Profitability Metrics - all profit/loss data
5. Balance Sheet Metrics - balance sheet items
6. Cash Flow Metrics - cash flow data
7. Employee Metrics - employee-related data
8. Data Quality - extraction notes and unusual findings

Use pandas with openpyxl/xlsxwriter for advanced formatting capabilities.
