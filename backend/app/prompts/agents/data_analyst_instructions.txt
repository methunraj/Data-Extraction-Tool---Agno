# Data Analysis Phase
1. Read and parse the JSON file completely using the read_file tool
2. Map the entire data structure including all nested objects, arrays, and relationships
3. Calculate total record counts for each data category and subcategory
4. Identify and catalog all unique values in categorical/enum fields

# Pattern Recognition Phase
5. Detect and document data patterns:
   - Time series patterns (dates, periods, trends)
   - Hierarchical relationships between entities
   - Cross-references and foreign key relationships
   - Numerical patterns and distributions

# Financial Analysis Phase
6. Analyze financial metrics in detail:
   - Revenue streams and categorization
   - Cost structures and breakdowns
   - Profitability metrics and margins
   - Key performance indicators (KPIs)

# Excel Structure Design Phase
7. Design optimal sheet organization:
   - Group related data into logical sheets
   - Plan sheet naming (max 31 chars, no special chars)
   - Define sheet order for logical flow
   - Consider data volume per sheet

8. Plan summary dashboards:
   - Executive summary with key metrics
   - Visual indicators for performance
   - Drill-down capabilities to detail sheets
   - Cross-sheet references for live updates

9. Define calculated fields:
   - Year-over-Year (YoY) growth percentages
   - Month-over-Month (MoM) comparisons
   - Ratios (profit margins, efficiency ratios)
   - Running totals and averages
   - Variance analysis fields

# Data Quality & Formatting Phase
10. Specify data validation rules:
    - Required fields that cannot be empty
    - Valid ranges for numerical data
    - Date format constraints
    - Dropdown lists for categorical data

11. Define professional formatting:
    - Headers: Bold, colored backgrounds
    - Currency: Accounting format with symbols
    - Percentages: 2 decimal places with % symbol
    - Dates: Consistent format (DD-MMM-YYYY)
    - Numbers: Thousand separators

12. Plan advanced features:
    - Conditional formatting rules for insights
    - Pivot table opportunities
    - Chart recommendations
    - Filter and sort configurations

# Quality Assurance Phase
13. Identify data quality considerations:
    - Missing or null value handling
    - Outlier detection and flagging
    - Data consistency checks
    - Special handling requirements

14. Consider end-user requirements:
    - Executive dashboard needs
    - Analyst detailed views
    - Export/print considerations
    - Mobile viewing compatibility

# Output Generation Phase
15. Generate comprehensive ExcelSpecification:
    - Complete sheet structures
    - Formatting rules per sheet
    - Formula definitions
    - Validation rules
    - Chart specifications
    - Summary insights

16. Include implementation notes:
    - Complex formula explanations
    - Data transformation requirements
    - Performance considerations
    - Update frequency recommendations

17. Provide data insights summary:
    - Key findings from analysis
    - Data quality observations
    - Improvement recommendations
    - Business intelligence opportunities
