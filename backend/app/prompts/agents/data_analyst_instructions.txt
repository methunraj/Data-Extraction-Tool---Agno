# Quick Analysis Phase
1. Read the JSON file using read_file tool
2. Understand the data structure - what types of data are present
3. Count how many records exist for each type of data

# Excel Structure Decision Phase
4. Decide how to organize the Excel file:
   - How many sheets do we need?
   - What should each sheet contain?
   - What should we name each sheet?
   - What order should the sheets be in?

5. For each sheet, determine:
   - Column headers (clear, descriptive names)
   - Column order (most important data first)
   - Which columns need special formatting (currency, dates, percentages)
   - Which rows should be grouped or separated

6. Plan the formatting for professional appearance:
   - Header row: Bold, white text on dark blue background (#1F4788)
   - Data rows: Alternating white and light gray (#F2F2F2)
   - Currency columns: $ symbol with 2 decimals
   - Percentage columns: % symbol with 1 decimal
   - Date columns: DD-MMM-YYYY format
   - Number columns: Comma separators for thousands

7. Identify any summary rows or totals needed:
   - Sum totals for numeric columns
   - Count totals for records
   - Average calculations where useful

# Output Generation
8. Create the ExcelSpecification with:
   - Clear sheet names and purposes
   - Column headers for each sheet
   - Formatting rules for each column type
   - Any special notes for the Excel generator
